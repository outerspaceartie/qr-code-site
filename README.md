## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use the :root pseudo-class element to make my code neater

```css
:root {
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --gray-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
  --dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
  --light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue using the :root pseudo-class element as well
